<h3>ModbusAttr</h3>
<ul>
    ModbusAttr uses the low level Modbus module 98_Modbus.pm to provide a generic Modbus module (as master, slave, relay or passive listener) that can be configured by attributes similar to the way HTTPMOD works for devices with a web interface. <br>
    ModbusAttr can be used as a Modbus master (sometimes also called a Modbus client) that queries data from other devices over a serial RS232 / RS485 or TCP connection, <br>
    it can be used as a Modbus slave (sometimes also called a Modbus server) that can make readings of Fhem devices available via Modbus to external Modbus masters,<br>
    it can act as a Modbus relay that receives requests over one connection and forwards them over another connection (e.g. from Modbus TCP to serial Modbus RTU)<br>
    or it can passively listen to other devices that communicate over a serial RS485 connection and extract readings from the objects it sees.<br>
    The supported protocols are Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII or Modbus TCP.<br>
    There are several attributes that modify the way data objects are converted before they are stored in readings or sent to a device. Data can be modified by a perl expression defined in an atribute, formatted with a format string defined in another attribute or mapped to a table defined in an attribute.<br>
    Readings can directly correspond to one data object or they can span several objects. A float value for example might be stored in two input or holding registers in the Modbus device. By specifying attributes that define the type of an object no perl coding is necessary.

    <br><br>
    <b>Prerequisites</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
          This module requires the basic Modbus module which itsef requires DevIO which again requires Device::SerialPort or Win32::SerialPort module if you connect devices to a serial port (RS232 or RS485).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <a id="ModbusAttr-define"></a>
    <b>Define that Fhem acts as a Modbus master (sometimes called a Modbus client) that queries a slave (sometimes called a Modbus server)</b>
    <ul>
        <ul><code>
        define <iodevice> Modbus /dev/device@baudrate,bits,parity,stop<br>
        define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; &lt;Interval&gt;
        </code><br>
        or<br>
        <code>
        define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; &lt;Interval&gt; &lt;Address:Port&gt; &lt;RTU|ASCII|TCP&gt;
        </code></ul><br>
        
        In the first case the module connects as a master to the external Modbus slave device with Modbus Id &lt;Id&gt; through a serial modbus device (RS232 or RS485). Therefore a physical [[Modbus]] device is defined first<br>
        In the second case the module connects as a master directly through Modbus TCP or Modbus RTU or ASCII over TCP to a slave device in the network.<br>
        If &lt;Interval&gt; is not 0 then the module actively requests data from the external device every &lt;Interval&gt; seconds <br><br>
        The objects that the module should request and the readings it should create from these objects have to be defined with attributes (see below). <br>
        These attributes will define a mapping from so called "coils", "digital inputs", "input registers" or "holding registers" of the external device to readings inside Fhem together with the data type and format of the values.<br>
        Interval can be 0 in which case the Module only requests data when it is triggered with a Fhem get-Command.<br>
        With this mode a Fhem installation can for example query sensor data from a heating system, energy meter or solar power installation if these systems offer a Modbus interface.
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        <ul><code>
        define ModbusLine Modbus /dev/ttyUSB1@9600<br>
        define WP ModbusAttr 1 60       
        </code></ul><br>
        Defines the Fhem device WP as a Modbus master that communicates through the Modbus serial interface device named ModbusLine to query a Modbus slave with id 1. The protocol defaults to Modbus RTU<br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>
        define ModbusLine Modbus /dev/ttyUSB1@9600<br>
        define WP ModbusAttr 20 0 ASCII
        </code></ul><br>
        Defines the Fhem device WP as a Modbus master that communicates through the Modbus serial interface device named ModbusLine with Modbus ASCII. 
        Use Modbus Id 20 and don't query the device in a defined interval. Instead individual SET / GET options have to be used for communication.<br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define WP ModbusAttr 5 60 192.168.1.122:502 TCP</code></ul><br>
        to talk Modbus TCP to a slave device with IP-Address 192.168.1.122 and the reserved port for Modbus TCP 502<br>
        Note that for Modbus over a TCP connection you don't need a basic Modbus device for the interface like ModbusLine above. <br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define WP ModbusAttr 3 60 192.168.1.122:8000 RTU</code></ul><br>
        to talk Modbus RTU over TCP and use the port number 8000<br>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <b>Define that Fhem acts as a Modbus slave (=server) that can be queried by a Modbus master</b>
    <ul>
        <code>define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; slave|server</code><br>
        or<br>
        <code>define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; slave|server| &lt;Address:Port&gt; &lt;RTU|ASCII|TCP&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        The module waits for connections from other Modbus masters. It will respond to their requests if the requests contain the given Modbus &lt;Id&gt;<br>
        To provide data with Modbus to external Modbus masters a mapping needs to be defined using attributes. 
        These attributes will define a mapping from Readings inside Fhem to so called "coils", "digital inputs", "input registers" or "holding registers" and their Modbus object address together with the data type and format of the values.<br>
        With this mode a Fhem installation can for example supply data to a PLC that actively reads data from Fhem or writes data to Fhem readings.
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        <ul><code>define MRS485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2@9600,8,E,1<br>
                  define Data4PLC ModbusAttr 1 slave</code></ul><br>
        Define Data4PLC as a Modbus slave (the old name for sever) that communicates through the Modbus serial interface device named MRS485 to listen for Modbus requests with Id 1. The protocol defaults to Modbus RTU<br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define MRS485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2@9600,8,E,1<br>
                  define Data4PLC ModbusAttr 20 slave ASCII</code></ul><br>
        to listen for Modbus requests with Id 20 with Modbus ASCII. <br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define Data4PLC ModbusAttr 5 slave 192.168.1.2:502 TCP</code></ul><br>
        to start listening to TCP port 502 on the local address 192.168.1.2. Modbus TCP will be used as protocol and requests with Modbus Id 5 will be answered.<br>
        Please be aware that opening a port number smaller than 1024 needs root permissions on Unix devices. So it is probably better to use a non standard port number above 1024 instead.<br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define Data4PLC ModbusAttr 3 slave 192.168.1.2:8000 RTU</code></ul><br>
        to listen to the local port 8000 and talk Modbus RTU over TCP<br>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <b>Define as Modbus passive listener</b>
    <ul>
        <code>define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; passive &lt;RTU|ASCII|TCP&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        The module listens on a serial (RS485) connection for modbus communication with the given Modbus &lt;Id&gt; and extracts readings. It does not send requests by itself but waits for another master (client) to communicate with a slave (server). So only objects that the other master requests can be seen by Fhem in this configuration. <br>
        The objects that the module recognizes and the readings that it should create from these objects have to be defined with attributes (see below) in the same way as for a Modbus master. <br>
        These attributes will define a mapping from so called "coils", "digital inputs", "input registers" or "holding registers" of the external device to readings inside Fhem together with the data type and format of the values.<br>
        With this mode a Fhem installation can for example listen to the communication between an energy counter as slave and a solar control system as master if they use Modbus RTU over RS485. Since only one Master is allowed when using Modbus over serial lines, Fhem can not be master itself. As a passive listener it can however see when the master queries e.g. the current power consumption and then also see the reply from the energy meter and store the value in a Fhem reading.
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        <ul><code>define MB-485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2<br>
                  define WP ModbusAttr 1 passive</code></ul><br>
        to passively listen for Modbus requests and replies with Id 1 over a serial interface managed by an already defined basic modbus device named MB-485. The protocol defaults to Modbus RTU<br>
        or <br>
        <ul><code>define MB-485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2<br>
                  define WP ModbusAttr 20 passive ASCII</code></ul><br>
        to passivel listen for Modbus requests / replies with Id 20 and Modbus ASCII. <br>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <b>Define as Modbus relay</b>
    <ul>
        <code>define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; relay to &lt;FhemMasterDevice&gt;</code><br>
        or<br>
        <code>define &lt;name&gt; ModbusAttr &lt;Id&gt; relay &lt;Address:Port&gt; &lt;RTU|ASCII|TCP&gt; to &lt;FhemMasterDevice&gt;</code><br>
        <br>
        The module waits for connections from other Modbus masters. It will forward requests if they match the given Modbus &lt;Id&gt; to an already defined Modbus Master device inside Fhem which will send them to its defined slave, take the reply and then pass it back to the original Master.<br>
        With this mode a Fhem installation can for example be used in front of a device that only speaks Modbus RTU over RS485 to make it available via Modbus TCP over the local network. 
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        <ul><code>define MB-485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2<br>
                  define Heating ModbusAttr 22 0<br>
                  define Relay ModbusAttr 33 relay 192.168.1.2:1502 TCP to Heating</code></ul><br>
        Defines MB-485 as a base device for the RS-485 communication with a heating system, <br>
        defines Heating as a Modbus Master to communicate with the heating and its Modbus ID 22, <br>
        and then defines the relay which listens to the local IP address 192.168.1.2, TCP port 1502, Modbus Id 33 and protocol Modbus-TCP.<br>
        Requests coming in through Modbus TCP and port 1502 are then translated to Modbus RTU and forwarded via RS-485 to the heating system with Modbus Id 22. <br>
        or (unlikely)<br>
        <ul><code>define MB-232 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2@19200<br>
                  define Solar ModbusAttr 7 0 192.168.1.122:502 RTU<br>
                  define PLC2NetRelay ModbusAttr 1 ASCII relay to Solar</code></ul><br>
        Defines MB-232 as a base device for the RS-232 communication with a PLC as Modbus master, <br>
        defines Solar as a Modbus Master to communicate with Modbus TCP to a Solar power system at IP Adrress 192.168.1.122 and its Modbus ID 7, <br>
        and then defines the PLC2NetRelay as a relay which listens to Modbus-ASCII requests over the serial RS-232 link from a PLC to Modbus ID 1.<br>
        Requests to Modbus Id 1 coming in through the serial link are then translated to Modbus TCP and forwarded over the network to the solar power system with Modbus Id 7. <br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    
    <a id="ModbusAttr-configuration"></a>
    <b>Configuration of the module as master or passive listener</b>
    <ul>
        Data objects (holding registers, input registers, coils or discrete inputs) are defined using attributes. 
        If Fhem is Modbus master or passive listener, the attributes assign data objects of external devices (heating systems, power meters, PLCs or other) with their register addresses to readings inside fhem and control how these readings are calculated from the raw values and how they are formatted.<br>
        Please be aware that Modbus does not define common data types so the representation of a value can be very different from device to device. One device might make a temperature value avaliable as a floating point value that is stored in two holding registers, another device might store the temperature multiplied with 10 as an signed integer in one register. Even the order of bytes can vary.<br>
        Therefore it is typically necessary to specify the data representation as a Perl unpack code.<br>
        A Modbus master can also write values to Objects in the device and attributes define how this is done.<br><br>
        
        Example for a Modbus master or passive configuration:<br>
        <pre>
        define PWP ModbusAttr 5 30
        attr PWP obj-h256-reading Temp_Wasser_ein
        attr PWP obj-h256-type signed short big
        attr PWP obj-h256-expr $val/10

        attr PWP obj-h258-reading Temp_Wasser_Aus
        attr PWP obj-h258-type signed short big
        attr PWP obj-h258-expr $val/10

        attr PWP obj-h262-reading Temp_Luft
        attr PWP obj-h262-type signed short big
        attr PWP obj-h262-expr $val / 10

        attr PWP obj-h770-reading Temp_Soll
        attr PWP obj-h770-type signed short big
        attr PWP obj-h770-expr $val / 10
        attr PWP obj-h770-set 1
        attr PWP obj-h770-setexpr $val * 10
        attr PWP obj-h770-max 32
        attr PWP obj-h770-min 10
        attr PWP obj-h770-hint 8,10,20,25,28,29,30,30.5,31,31.5,32

        attr PWP dev-h-combine 5
        attr PWP dev-h-defPoll 1

        attr PWP room Pool-WP
        attr PWP stateFormat {sprintf("%.1f Grad", ReadingsVal($name,"Temp_Wasser_Ein",0))}
        attr PWP webCmd Temp_Soll
        </pre>
        
        Attributes to define data objects start with obj- followed by a code that identifies the type and address
        of the data object. <br>
        
        Modbus devices offer the following types of data objects: 
        <ul>
        <li> holding registers (16 bit objects that can be read and written)</li>
        <li> input registers (16 bit objects that can only be read)</li>
        <li> coils (single bit objects that can be read and written)</li>
        <li> discrete inputs (single bit objects that can only be read)</li>
        </ul>       
        <br>
        
        The module uses the first character of these data object types to define attributes. 
        Thus h770 refers to a holding register with the decimal address 770 and c120 refers to a coil with address 120. 
        The address has to be specified as pure decimal number. The address counting starts at address 0<br><br>
        
        Please note that the documentation for devices sometimes uses different numbering. They might start counting with one instead of zero so if a voltage value is stored in input register number 107 according to the documentation of the device, it might technically mean register number 106 (in the Modbus protocol specification addresses start with 0).<br>
        Also some vendors use hexadecimal descriptions of their register addresses. So input register 107 might be noted as hex and means 263 or even 262 as decimal address.<br>
        
        <code>attr PWP obj-h258-reading Temp_Wasser_Aus</code> defines a reading with the name Temp_Wasser_Aus that is read from the Modbus holding register at address 258.<br>
        The attributes ending on <code>-type</code> specify the data type. In the above example <code>signed short big</code> is a 16 bit signed integer in big endian byte ordering. this information is used by the modbus module to select the correct perl unpack code and length. instead of using a -type attribute it is also possible to specify this unpack code and length explixitely (in older versions of the Fhem Modbus module this was necessary)<br>
        With the attribute ending on <code>-expr</code> you can define a perl expression to do some conversion or calculation on the raw value read from the device. 
        In the above example the raw value has to be devided by 10 to get the real value. If the raw value is also the final value then no <code>-expr</code> attribute is necessary. <br><br>
        
        An object attribute ending on <code>-set</code> creates a fhem set option which allows the user to issue a set command which then sends a Modbus write request to the device.
        In the above example the reading Temp_Soll can be changed to 12 degrees by the user with the fhem command <code>set PWP Temp_Soll 12</code><br>
        The object attributes ending on <code>-min</code> and <code>-max</code> define min and max values for input validation 
        and the attribute ending on <code>-hint</code> will tell fhem to create a selection list so the user can graphically select the defined values.<br><br>
        
        To define general properties of the device you can specify attributes starting with <code>dev-</code>. 
        E.g. with <code>dev-timing-timeout</code> you can specify the timeout when waiting for a response from the device. 
        With <code>dev-h-</code> you can specify several default values or general settings for all holding registers 
        like the function code to be used when reading or writing holding registers. 
        These attributes are optional and the module will use defaults that work in most cases. <br>
        <code>dev-h-combine 5</code> for example allows the module to combine read requests to objects having an address that differs 5 or less into one read request. 
        Without setting this attribute the module will start individual read requests for each object. 
        Typically the documentation for the modbus interface of a given device states the maximum number of objects that can be read in one function code 3 request.<br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <a id="ModbusAttr-dataTypes"></a>
    <b>Handling Data Types</b>
    <ul>
        The Modbus protocol does not define data types. If the documentation of a device states that for example the current temperature is stored in holding register 102 this leaves room for many interpretations. Not only can the address 102 mean different things (actually decimal 102 or rather 101 if the vendor starts counting at 1 instead of 0 or even 257 or 258 if the vendor used hexadecimal addresses in his documentation ) also the data representation can be many different things. As in every programming language, there are many ways to represent numbers. They can be stored signed or unsigned, they can be integers or floating point numbers, the byte-order can be "big endian" or "small endian", the value can be stored in one holding register or in two holding registers (floating point numbers typically take four bytes which means two holding registers).<br>
        The Modbus module allows flexible configuration of data representations by assigning a predefined type and by assigning a Perl unpack-code, a length, a Perl Expression, and the register ordering. The following example illustrates how this can be done:<br>        
        <pre>
        attr PWP obj-h338-reading Pressure
        attr PWP obj-h338-len 2
        attr PWP obj-h338-unpack f>
        attr PWP obj-h338-revRegs 1
        attr PWP obj-h338-format %.2f
        </pre>
        In This example a floating point value for the reading "Pressure" is read from the holding registers starting at address 338. 
        The value occupies 32 Bits and is therefore stored in two registers. The Perl pack code to use is f> which means a native single precision float in big endian format (byte order). With revRegs the module is instructed to reverse the order of the registers directly after reading. The format specification then defines how the value is formatted into a reading - in this case with two digits after the comma. See http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pack.html for Perl pack / unpack codes and http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sprintf.html for format specifications.<br>
        <br>
        If you need to read / write many objects for a device, defining all these parameters each time is not elegant. The Modbus module therefore offers two ways to simplify this task: <br>
        You can use defaults for every type of object or you can use predefined types or define your own data types once and then refer to them.<br>
        This exampe shows how defaults can be specified for holding registers and input registers:<br>
        <pre>
        attr PWP dev-h-defUnpack f>
        attr PWP dev-h-defLen 2
        attr PWP dev-h-defRevRegs 1
        attr PWP dev-h-defFormat %.2f
        
        attr PWP dev-i-defUnpack n
        attr PWP dev-i-defLen 1
        </pre>

        The next example shows how you can define your own data types and then apply them to objects:<br>
        <pre>
        attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-format %.1f
        attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-len 2

        This example defines a data type with the name VT_R4 which uses an unpack code of f>, length 2 and reversed register ordering. It then assigns this Type to the objects Temp_In and Temp_Out.<br>
        <br>
        The following data types are already defined and can directly be used instead of specifying unpack codes and lengths:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>signed short big</li>
            16 bits signed integer in big endian byte ordering (high, low)
        <li>unsigned short big</li>
            16 bits unsigned integer in big endian byte ordering
        <li>signed short little</li>
            16 bits signed integer in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high)
        <li>unsigned short little</li>
            16 bits unsigned integer in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high)
        <li>signed long big</li>
            32 bits signed integer in big endian byte ordering (high, low), occupies two registers
        <li>unsigned long big</li>
            32 bits unsigned integer in big endian byte ordering, occupies two registers
        <li>signed long little</li>
            32 bits signed integer in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high), occupies two registers
        <li>unsigned long little</li>
            32 bits unsigned integer in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high), occupies two registers
        <li>float32 big</li>
            32 bits floating point number in big endian byte ordering, occupies two registers
        <li>float32 little</li>
            32 bits floating point number in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high), occupies two registers
        <li>float64 big</li>
            64 bits floating point number in big endian byte ordering, occupies four registers
        <li>float64 little</li>
            64 bits floating point number in vax / little endian byte ordering (low high), occupies four registers
        <li>string</li>
            string with default lenght 2 so the length should be overwritten as needed
        </ul>
        additionally there are some predefined abbreviations / aliases for these predefined data types. For exmple the word big can be omitted so unsigned short is the same as unsigned short big or real is an alias for float32 big and double is an alias for floa64 big.
    </ul>

    <a id="ModbusAttr-configurationSlave"></a>
    <b>Configuration of the module as Modbus slave (server)</b>
    <ul>
        Data objects that the module offers to external Modbus masters (holding registers, input registers, coils or discrete inputs) are defined using attributes. 
        If Fhem is Modbus slave, the attributes assign readings of Fhem devices to Modbus objects with their addresses and control how these objects are calculated from the reading values that exist in Fhem.<br>
        It is also possible to allow an external Modbus master to send write function codes and change the value of readings inside Fhem.
        
        Example for a Modbus slave configuration:<br>
        <pre>
        define MRS485 Modbus /dev/ttyUSB2@9600,8,E,1
        define Data4PLC ModbusAttr 1 slave
        attr Data4PLC IODev MRS485
        
        attr Data4PLC obj-h256-reading THSensTerrasse:temperature
        attr Data4PLC obj-h256-unpack f
        attr Data4PLC obj-h256-len 2
        
        attr Data4PLC obj-h258-reading THSensTerrasse:humidity
        attr Data4PLC obj-h258-unpack f
        attr Data4PLC obj-h258-len 2
        
        attr Data4PLC obj-h260-reading myDummy:limit
        attr Data4PLC obj-h260-unpack n
        attr Data4PLC obj-h260-len 1
        attr Data4PLC obj-h260-allowWrite 1
        </pre>
        
        In this example Fhem allows an external Modbus master to read the temperature of a Fhem device named THSensTerrasse through holding register 256 and the humidity of that Fhem device through holding register 258. Both are encoded as floting point values that span two registers. <br>
        Instead of specifying unpack codes and lengths predefined data types could be used here as well.
        The master can also read but also write the reading named limit of the device myDummy.
        
    </ul>
    <br>    
    
    <a id="ModbusAttr-set"></a>
    <b>Set-Commands for Fhem as Modbus master operation</b>
    <ul>
        are created based on the attributes defining the data objects.<br>
        Every object for which an attribute like <code>obj-xy-set</code> is set to 1 will create a valid set option.<br>
        Additionally the attribute <code>enableControlSet</code> enables the set options <code>interval</code>, <code>stop</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>reread</code> as well as <code>scanModbusObjects</code>, <code>scanStop</code> and <code>scanModbusId</code> (for devices connected with RTU / ASCII over a serial line).<br>
        Starting with Version 4 of the Modbus module enableControlSet defaults to 1.<br>
        <ul>
            <li><code>interval &lt;Interval&gt;</code></li>
                modifies the interval that was set during define. 
            <li><code>stop</code></li>
                stops the interval timer that is used to automatically poll objects through modbus.
            <li><code>start</code></li>
                starts the interval timer that is used to automatically poll objects through modbus. If an interval is specified during the define command then the interval timer is started automatically. However if you stop it with the command <code>set &lt;mydevice&gt; stop</code> then you can start it again with <code>set &lt;mydevice&gt; start</code>.
            <li><code>reread</code></li>
                causes a read of all objects that are set to be polled in the defined interval. The interval timer is not modified.
            <br>
            <li><code>scanModbusObjects &lt;startObj&gt; - &lt;endObj&gt; &lt;reqLen&gt;</code></li>
                scans the device objects and automatically creates attributes for each reply it gets. This might be useful for exploring devices without proper documentation. The following example starts a scan and queries the
                holding registers with addresses between 100 and 120. <br>
                <code>set MyModbusAttrDevice scanModbusObjects h100-120</code><br>
                For each reply it gets, the module creates a reading like<br>
                <code>scan-h100 hex=0021, string=.!, s=8448, s>=33, S=8448, S>=33</code><br>
                the representation of the result as hex is 0021 and
                the ASCII representation is .!. s, s>, S and S> are different representations with their Perl pack-code.
            <li><code>scanModbusId &lt;startId&gt; - &lt;endId&gt; &lt;knownObj&gt;</code></li>
                scans for Modbus Ids on an RS485 Bus. The following set command for example starts a scan:<br>
                <code>set Device scanModbusId 1-7 h770</code><br>
                since many modbus devices don't reply at all if an object is requested that does not exist, scanModbusId 
                needs the adress of an object that is known to exist.
                If a device with Id 5 replies to a read request for holding register 770, a reading like the following will be created:<br>
                <code>scanId-5-Response-h770 hex=0064, string=.d, s=25600, s>=100, S=25600, S>=100</code>
            <li><code>scanStop</code></li>
                stops any running scans.
            <li><code>saveAsModule &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
                experimental: saves the definitions of obj- and dev- attributes in a new fhem module file as /tmp/98_ModbusGen&lt;name&gt;.pm.<br>
                if this file is copied into the fhem module subdirectory (e.g. /opt/fhem/FHEM) and fhem is restarted then instead of defining a device
                as ModbusAttr with all the attributes to define objects, you can just define a device of the new type ModbusGen&lt;name&gt; and all the 
                objects will be there by default. However all definitions can still be changed / overriden with the attribues defined in ModbusAttr if needed.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <a id="ModbusAttr-get"></a>
    <b>Get-Commands for Modbus master operation</b><br>
    <ul>
        All readings are also available as Get commands. Internally a Get command triggers the corresponding 
        request to the device and then interprets the data and returns the right field value. 
        To avoid huge option lists in FHEMWEB, the objects visible as Get in FHEMWEB can be defined by setting an attribute <code>obj-xy-showGet</code> to 1. 
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <a id="ModbusAttr-customFC"></a>
    <b>custom function codes</b><br>
    <ul>
        if a device supports special function codes beyond 1-6 and 15-17 then they can be defined and used with attributes that define how the requests and replies for such function codes are constructed and how they can be parsed.<br><br>
        
        simple example for a function code that does not contain data:<br>
        <pre>
        attr Master dev-fc66Request-unpack none
        attr Master dev-fc66Response-unpack none
        
        attr Master obj-h9999-reading Reset
        attr Master obj-h9999-set 1
        attr Master obj-h9999-overrideFCwrite 66
        </pre>
        the unpack none specifies that there is no field in the request with function code 66, the message just consists of the function code and the checksum for modbus RTU.<br>
        To use a custom function code, it can be assigned to an individual virtual object with the obj-XY-overrideFCwrite attribute so a set command to this object will use the custom function code 
        and pass the objects type, address and length via the fields TYPE, ADR and LEN. In the above example TYPE, ADR and LEN are not even used.<br><br>
        
        The next example defines function code 93 for a master which behaves just like function code 3 to read holding registers:<br>
        <ul>
        <pre>
        attr Master dev-fc93Request-unpack nn
        attr Master dev-fc93Request-fieldList ADR, LEN

        attr Master dev-fc93Response-unpack Ca*
        attr Master dev-fc93Response-fieldList LEN, VALUES
        attr Master dev-fc93Response-fieldExpr-PDULEXP $pduHash->{LEN} + 2
        attr Master dev-fc93Response-fieldExpr-TYPE 'h'
        </pre>
        
        the relevant part for a custom function code request and response is the part between the modbus id and the checksum (for RTU). 
        This part is defined with an unpack code and a list of Fields that correspond to the fields defined by the unpack code elements.<br>
        See the Modbus specification for details on how the request and response looks like for function code 3<br>
        Possible fields for custom function codes are ADR, LEN, TYPE, VALUES and PDULEXP.<br><br>
        
        Example for a slave:
        <pre>
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Request-unpack nn
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Request-fieldList ADR, LEN
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Request-fieldExpr-PDULEXP 5
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Request-fieldExpr-TYPE 'h'

        attr Slave  dev-fc93Response-unpack Ca*
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Response-fieldList LEN, VALUES
        attr Slave  dev-fc93Response-fieldExpr-LEN $val * 2;
        </pre>
        
        The unpack code nn stands for two 16 bit unsigned numbers. <br>
        The field TYPE is set with a Perl expression to h (in this case only the constant h)<br>
        ADR, LEN specify that the numbers unpacked are the holding register address and the length in registers.<br>
        The field PDULEXP is the expected length of the PDU including the leading Modbus ID byte.<br>
        For the response this expected PFU length is calculated by adding 2 to the unpacked field LEN
        For the slave the length field LEN is doubled because in the protocol for function code 3 it means the length in bytes whereas in the module the length means the number of 16 bit registers.<br>
        If during parsing the fields TYPE, ADR and VALUES are set and there is an object / reading with that type and address defined, then the field VALUES is passed on for interpretation as this object.<br>

        the following list of attributes can be applied to any data object by specifying the objects type and address in the variable part. 
        For many attributes you can also specify default values per object type (see dev- attributes later) or you can specify an object attribute without type and address 
        (e.g. obj-len) which then applies as default for all objects:
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-reading" data-pattern="obj-.*-reading">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-reading</a><br> 
            define the name of a reading that corresponds to the modbus data object of type c,d,i or h and a decimal address (e.g. obj-h225-reading).<br>
            For master or passive operation this reading name will be used to create a reading for the modbus device itself. <br>
            For slave operation this can also be specified as deviceName:readingName to refer to the reading of another device inside Fhem whose value can be queried by an external Modbus master with the goven type and address.<br>

            which results in a modbus write request sent to the external slave device.<br>
            (works only if this device is a modbus master and for holding registers and coils 
            since discrete inputs and input registers can not be modified by definition).<br>

            In slave mode this defines a format string to format a value from a Fhem reading before it is sent back in a response to an external master <br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-format %.1f
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-len" data-pattern="obj-.*-len">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-len</a><br> 
            defines the length of the data object in registers (16 Bits). It defaults to 1. <br>
            Some devices store e.g. 32 bit floating point values in two registers. In this case you should set this attribute to two.<br>
            This setting is relevant both in master and in slave mode. The lenght has to match the length implied by the unpack code. <br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-len 2
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-unpack" data-pattern="obj-.*-unpack">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-unpack</a><br> 
            defines the pack / unpack code to convert data types.<br>
            In master mode it converts the raw data string read from the external slave device to a reading or to convert from a reading to a raw format when a write request is sent to the external slave device.<br>
            In slave mode it converts the value of a reading in Fhem to a raw format that can be sent as a response to an external Modbus master or it converts the raw data string read from the external master device to a reading when the master is using a write function code and writing has been allowed.<br>
            For an unsigned integer in big endian format this would be "n", <br>
            for a signed 16 bit integer in big endian format this would be "s>", in little endian format it would be "s<" <br>
            and for a 32 bit big endian float value this would be e.g. "f>". (see the perl documentation of the pack function for more codes and details).<br>
            Please note that you also have to set a -len attribute (for this object or for the device) if you specify an unpack code that consumes data from more than one register.<br>
            For a 32 bit float e.g. len should be 2.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-unpack n

        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-revRegs" data-pattern="obj-.*-revRegs">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-revRegs</a><br> 
            this is only applicable to objects that span several input registers or holding registers. <br>
            When they are received from an external device then the order of the registers will be reversed before further interpretation / unpacking 
            of the raw register string. The same happens before data is sent to an external device<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-revRegs 1
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-bswapRegs" data-pattern="obj-.*-bswapRegs">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-bswapRegs</a><br>
            After registers have been received and before they are sent, the byte order of all 16-bit values are swapped. This changes big-endian to little-endian or vice versa. This functionality is most likely used for reading (ASCII) strings from devices where they are stored as big-endian 16-bit values. <br>
            Example: original reading is "324d3130203a57577361657320722020". After applying bswapRegs, the value will be "4d3230313a2057576173736572202020"
            which will result in the ASCII string "M201: WWasser   ". Should be used with "(a*)" as -unpack value.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-bswapRegs 1
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-decode" data-pattern="obj-.*-decode"></a><br> 
            defines an encoding to be used in a call to the perl function decode to convert the raw data string received from a device. 
            This can be used if the device delivers strings in an encoding like cp850 instead of utf8.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-decode cp850
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-encode" data-pattern="obj-.*-encode">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-encode</a><br> 
            defines an encoding to be used in a call to the perl function encode to convert raw data strings received from a device. 
            This can be used if the device delivers strings in an encoding like cp850 and after decoding it you want to reencode it to e.g. utf8.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-encode utf8
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[ih][0-9]+-type" data-pattern="obj-.*-type">obj-[ih][0-9]+-type</a><br> 
            defines that this object has a predefined or user defined data type. Data types can be defined using the dev-type- attribues.<br>
            If a device with many objects uses for example floating point values that span two swapped registers with the unpack code f>, then instead of specifying the -unpack, -revRegs, -len, -format and other attributes over and over again, you could define a data type with attributes that start with dev-type-VT_R4- and then use this definition for each object as e.g. obj-h1234-type VT_R4<br>
            example:<br>
            <pre>
            attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-format %.1f
            attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-len 2
            attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-revRegs 1
            attr WP dev-type-VT_R4-unpack f>
            
            attr WP obj-h1234-reading Temp_Ist
            attr WP obj-h1234-type VT_R4
            </pre><br>
            see above for a list of predefined data types.

        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-showGet" data-pattern="obj-.*-showGet">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-showGet</a><br> 
            If the Fhem Modbus device is in master mode, every reading can also be requested by a get command. 
            However these get commands are not automatically offered in fhemweb. By specifying this attribute, the get will be visible in fhemweb.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-showGet 1
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-poll" data-pattern="obj-.*-poll">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-poll</a><br>
            If the Fhem Modbus device is in master mode, Fhem automatically creates read requests to the external modbus slave.
            If this attribute is set to 1 for an object then this obeject is included in the cyclic update request as specified in the define command for a Modbus master. 
            If not set, then the object can manually be requested with a get command, but it is not automatically updated each interval. 
            Note that this setting can also be specified as default for all objects with the dev- atributes described later.<br>
            This attribute is ignored in slave mode.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-poll 1
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-polldelay" data-pattern="obj-.*-pollDelay">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-polldelay</a><br> 
            this applies only to master mode. It allows to poll objects at a lower rate than the interval specified in the define command. 
            You can either specify a time in seconds or number prefixed by "x" which means a multiple of the interval of the define command.<br>
            If you specify a normal numer then it is interpreted as minimal time between the last read and another automatic read.<br>
            Please note that this does not create an additional interval timer. 
            Instead the normal interval timer defined by the interval of the define command will check if this reading is due or not yet. 
            So the effective interval will always be a multiple of the interval of the define.<br>
            If this attribute is set to "once" then the object will only be requested once after a restart.<br>
            Example: attr MBTest obj-h225-pollDelay x3
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-obj-[cdih][0-9]+-group" data-pattern="obj-.*-group">obj-[cdih][0-9]+-group</a><br> 
            Allows control over the way how objects are combined in one request and in which order they are processed when the response comes in.<br>
            example:<br>
            <pre>            
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-reading Temp
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-unpack f>
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-len 2
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-format %.2f
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-poll 1
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-expr ReadingsVal($name, 'TempMultiplyer', 1) * $val
            attr MyMaster obj-h100-group 1-2
            attr MyMaster obj-h102-reading TempMultiplyer
            attr MyMaster obj-h102-unpack f>
            attr MyMaster obj-h102-len 2
            attr MyMaster obj-h102-poll 1
            attr MyMaster obj-h102-group 1-1
            attr MyMaster dev-h-combine 8
            </pre><br>
            this will cause the holding registers 100 and 102 to be read together. When the response is received, 
            register 102 will be processed first so when register 100 is processed, its value can be multipied with the already updated reading for register 102.<br>
            This is helpful for devices where readings need to be computed out of several registers that need to be requested together and where the order of processing is important.

        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-nextOpenDelay2">nextOpenDelay2</a><br> 
            delay for Modbus-TCP connections. This defines how long the module should wait after any TCP connection attempt before the next reconnection attempt. This defaults to 2 seconds.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-openTimeout">openTimeout</a><br>     
            timeout to be used when opening a Modbus TCP connection (defaults to 3)
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-timeoutLogLevel">timeoutLogLevel</a><br> 
            log level that is used when logging a timeout. Defaults to 3. 
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-silentReconnect">silentReconnect</a><br> 
            if set to 1, then it will set the loglevel for "disconnected" and "reappeared" messages to 4 instead of 3. 
            This is especially useful when TCP slaves discoonect after an inactivity timeout.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-maxTimeoutsToReconnect">maxTimeoutsToReconnect</a><br> 
            this attribute is only valid for TCP connected devices. In such cases a disconnected device might stay undetected and lead to timeouts until the TCP connection is reopened. This attribute specifies after how many timeouts an automatic reconnect is tried.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-closeAfterResponse">closeAfterResponse</a><br> 
            if set to 1, then Fhem as Master will close TCP connections to Slaves after it received the response 
            and automatically reopen the connection to the slave when the next request has to be sent.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-nonPrioritizedSet">nonPrioritizedSet</a><br> 
            if set to 1, then set commands will not be sent on the bus before other queued requests and the response will not be waited for.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-nonPrioritizedGet">nonPrioritizedGet</a><br> 
            if set to 1, then get commands will not be blocking and the response will not be waited for.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-sortUpdate">sortUpdate</a><br> 
            this attribute has become obsolte. The requests during a getUpdate cycle will always be sorted before beeing queued.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-cacheUpdateHash">cacheUpdateHash</a><br> 
            if this attribute is set to 1 then then Fhem as Modbus-Master will ignore any pollDelays, cache the list of combined objects to be requested 
            and request this list in all subsequent getUpdate rounds in the defined interval. It has no effect on explicit get commands.<br>
            This will result in increased memory usage and potentially some performance increase.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-cacheParseInfo">cacheParseInfo</a><br> 
            if this attribute is set to 1 then then Fhem will cache the information regarding parsing each object in a hash 
            which results in increased memory usage and potentially some performance increase.
        </li>

        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-propagateVerbose">propagateVerbose</a><br> 
            this attribute causes changes to the verbose attribute of a logical device to be propagated to the physical io device 
            or if the logical device is a relay device to the master device used by the relay.
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-connectionsRoom">connectionsRoom</a><br> 
            defines to which room a TCP connection device for TCP slaves or relays is assigned to. 
            When a TCP slave accepts a connection then the new temporary connection device is by default assigned to the room "Connections".
            If this attribute is set to "none" then no room attribute is set for connection devices by the module 
            and fhem will automatically use the room 'hidden'.

        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-serverIdExpr">serverIdExpr</a><br> 
            sets the server id response to be sent back as client if a server is requesting it via function code 17<br>
            this is defiend as a perl expression for more flexibility.            
        </li>
        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-disable">disable</a><br>
            stop communication with the device while this attribute is set to 1. For Modbus over TCP this also closes the TCP connection.
        </li>

        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-dev-fc[\d]+Response-fieldList" data-pattern="dev-.*Response-fieldList">dev-fc[\d]+Response-fieldList</a><br>
            defines the fields that are used for creating or parsing a custom function code response.<br>
            Possible fields are TYPE, ADR, LEN, VALUES, PDULEXP. They correspond to the unpack code in the attribute above and are specified in a comma seperated list.

        <li><a id="ModbusAttr-attr-dev-fc[\d]+Response-fieldExpr" data-pattern="dev-.*Response-fieldExpr">dev-fc[\d]+Response-fieldExpr-.*</a><br>
            defines additional Perl expressions for the fields that are used for creating or parsing a custom function code response.<br>
            The correspondig field is the last part of the attribute name. Possible fields are TYPE, ADR, LEN, VALUES, PDULEXP.
